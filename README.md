# DarkModeAutoChangingLiveWallpaper

*This name is pretty crappy. Let's call it work in progress...*

This is an app that automatically switches between two static wallpaper based on whether or not dark mode is enabled. 
It ueses a Live Wallpaper service and listens for `uiMode` updates.

This is basically a poor man's version of [Automatic Dark Theme for Android 10](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cannic.apps.automaticdarktheme).
However, this does not require the special ADB permission to work.
